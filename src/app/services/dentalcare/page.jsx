Early dental care such as brush, using a dental food, water additives or gels, and dental scrubs, can help prevent the early appearance of many dental issues. Some breeds, however, are very prone to dental disease, and they may need cleanings at an early age. Dental disease can cause constant pain for your pets, and may lead to other serious problems, like heart disease, later in life. Regular dental exams and preventative care can help keep your pets healthy and happy.",
